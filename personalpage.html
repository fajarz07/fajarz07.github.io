<h2 style="color:#0F2F61;background-color:#FFFFFF">About Me

<h3 style="color:#54C8EE"> I go to <a href="https://stjohnthebaptistdhs.net/" target="_blank"> St Johns </a> in West Islip Ny and I'm about to go into junior year which is supposedly supposed to be the hardest year of highschool because of SATS, I'm still excited though because junior year is also really fun at my school. I am almost 16 years old since my birthday is in September and I can't wait to get my permit even though I suck at driving. I have two little brothers who get on my nerves but I still love them. I love listening to music, my favorite artist is Drake.

<h4 style="color:#0F2F61;background-color:#FFFFFF">Goals

<h3 style="color:#499EC6"> My current goal is to maintain A's and B's all of junior year. My distant goals are to score at least a 1300 on the SAT no matter how many tries it takes me. And my biggest dream/ goal is to get into NYU. Not only is it in my favorite city its also an amazing college to major in biology or premed and their medical school is free. Like hello who wouldn't want to go there. The medical school is very competetiv but getting into that medical school isnt my main concern, its geting into NYU that matters most to me.

<h3 style="color:#0F2F61;background-color:#FFFFFF"> Hobbies

<h3 style="color:#17739E"> During my free time I like to do pilates which is a type of workout and I do these while listening to music. I also love to practice lacrosse outside or just play any types of sports with my family or friends. I may not be good at all of them but I love to try.

<h3 style="color:#0F2F61;background-color:#FFFFFF"> Who I look up to 

<h3 style="color:#165572"> I have always looked up to my dad because he's just my favorite person on the planet. Whenever I have a bad day he's always there to put a smile on my face no matter how much attitude I give him. Whenever I get a bad grade on a test or quiz he never gets mad at me and just explain that everyone is different and no one is made to be good at everything. So if I got a bad grade on one test he just says that topic wasn't for me and he knows I tried my best and I can do bette on the next one. He just has so much patience and is so smart and funny. He just always wants me to be happy.
